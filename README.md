## Work Experience

### **Project Assistant** - Emotional Films, Public University of Navarre
_January 2021 - November 2022_
* I worked on the development of an app for massive data capture to create a huge (+1.5M images) dataset. The app controlled a computer with 9 webcams at different angles pointed to a person reacting to different images.
* I trained some different models for the project, namely an avatar generation convolutional neural network and a _face/not face_ discriminator network.
* I deployed and customized EasyAppointments to meet the needs of the project. This site allowed people to request an appointment for the previously mentioned data capture.
* I developed and deployed a ML model monitoring REST API using Flask, MongoDB and gunicorn.
* I woerked on the integration of our models into C++ applications.


## Stuff I made by myself
### Simple face swapping using OpenGL
Application I created to strenghten my OpenCV knowledge and learn some 3D object manipulation using Python. Code available [here](https://github.com/ibonn/faceswap_gl).

### SVG avatar package for Python
I created this package when I tried to add new svgs to the already existing [py_avataaars](https://github.com/kebu/py-avataaars) package. As this task was too difficult to do, I forked the project and tried to make the required modifications to achieve this goal. When I noticed that a complete refactor was required, I decided that I would create the library from scratch, and [here](https://github.com/ibonn/python_avatars) it is!

### 2D ePuck robot simulator
What do you do when no robots are available for one of your college assignments? You create a robot simulator! Yep, that is what I did, and it worked. It has some limitations due to time constraints, as I had to continue with the previously mentioned assignment. You can check it [here](https://github.com/ibonn/robotBox).
