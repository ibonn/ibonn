![Person programming](undraw_programming_re_kg9v.svg)

I am a Computer Science graduate by the Public University of Navarre. In my spare time I mantain some free software projects.

I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, but I like learning about many other fields in computer science such as cryptography, software engineering and cybersecurity. I currently use Python as my main programming language as it is the most versatile and popular for ML/DL and my favorite tools/frameworks are:

## Stuff I made by myself
### Simple face swapping using OpenGL
Application I created to strenghten my OpenCV knowledge and learn some 3D object manipulation using Python. Code available [here](https://github.com/ibonn/faceswap_gl).

### SVG avatar package for Python
I created this package when I tried to add new svgs to the already existing [py_avataaars](https://github.com/kebu/py-avataaars) package. As this task was too difficult to do, I forked the project and tried to make the required modifications to achieve this goal. When I noticed that a complete refactor was required, I decided that I would create the library from scratch, and [here](https://github.com/ibonn/python_avatars) it is!

### 2D ePuck robot simulator
What do you do when no robots are available for one of your college assignments? You create a robot simulator! Yep, that is what I did, and it worked. It has some limitations due to time constraints, as I had to continue with the previously mentioned assignment. You can check it [here](https://github.com/ibonn/robotBox).
